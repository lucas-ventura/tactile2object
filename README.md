## Generate grasps
First, we need to generate the grasps using the graspIt software. You can generate grasps from the YCB dataset following the instructions [here](https://github.com/lucas-ventura/mano_grasp#generate-grasps-from-ybc-dataset).

## Prepare objects for the [Convolutional Occupancy Networks](https://github.com/autonomousvision/convolutional_occupancy_networks) model
We will follow the instructions from [here](https://github.com/autonomousvision/occupancy_networks/tree/master/external/mesh-fusion).
